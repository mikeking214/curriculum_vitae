\section{Autonomous Underwater Vehicle}
\paragraph{Project:} Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for the \href{http://www.mcgillrobotics.com}{McGill Robotics Design Team}
\paragraph{Goal:} Design, analyze, manufacture, assemble and use an A.U.V. to compete in the \href{http://www.robosub.org}{AUVSI Robosub Competition} in San Diego, CA.
\paragraph{Process:} Two months are used to research existing teams and industry designs, develop concepts, and evaluate them based on cost, simplicity, and manufacturability.  Another two months are spent designing, CADing, and running FEA, to prepare for purchasing.  Machine drawings are made and materials are ordered over the next month.  Following this, one month is spent on machining, printing, and manufacturing, and less than a month assembling the components.  The next four months are left for unit testing, dry testing, and finally wet testing.  This period is also left open for any necessary redesign and manufacturing that will inevitably take place.  The vehicle must be ready for competition in June to allow for shipping and travel to San Diego.
In the next few pages, some of the major components that were CADed are shown in more detail.

\caption{AUV assembly}
\label{auv_assembly}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{auv_assembly} shows the current CAD model of the entire AUV. It consists of a frame, a main hull pressure vessel, two battery pressure vessels, three camera pressure vessels, a pneumatic valve housing, an IMU pressure vessel, two claw mechanisms, two marker dropping devices, two pneumatic torpedoes, a $CO_2$ tank, and six thrusters.  The majority of the materials are HDPE plastic, 3D-printed resin, and aluminum.  All designs are from scratch, except for fasteners and electrical components. 
\end{samepage}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{media/MAIN-HULL-RENDER-ALPHA.png}
\caption{Main hull pressure vessel}
\label{main_hull}
\end{figure}

The main hull houses most of the electronics and provides the majority of the buoyant force needed to keep the vehicle neutral and balanced. Inside, a rail system holds the electronics in place, and is removable from the front for easy access.  It attaches to the top of the frame, and connects all the electronic components using a set of waterproof connectors. 
\end{samepage}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{media/MAIN-HULL-RENDER-2-ALPHA.png}
\caption{Internal electronics rack}
\label{main_hull2}
\end{figure}

Inside is the custom-built, on-board computer, as well as three motor controllers, an Arduino Mega, and a custom-built power distribution PCB board.  These electronics are needed to manage the six thrusters, the sensor array, and the computer vision system.  The frame is made of aluminum rails, with plastic racks, and uses a face O-ring with four nuts and vacuum seal to keep it water-tight. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{media/GRABBER-RENDER-ALPHA.png}
\caption{Pneumatic claw device for picking up objects underwater}
\label{grabber}
\end{figure}

The pneumatic claw uses a double-acting piston to open and close two ``fingers'' of the claw, which are printed in an Stratasys Objet260 3D printer.  A lever on one of the fingers senses when an object has successfully been picked up using a custom, waterproof limit switch.  

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{media/MARKER-RENDER-ALPHA.png}
\caption{Pneumatic marker dropper device}
\label{marker}
\end{figure}

The pneumatic marker dropper uses a reverse-acting piston with a magnet to release a ball bearing marker when over a target.  It is printed in a FormLabs Form 1 3D printer and coated with a protective sealant.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{media/TORPEDO-RENDER-ALPHA.png}
\caption{Pneumatic torpedo launcher}
\label{torpedo}
\end{figure}

The torpedo launcher uses a pneumatic piston to fire a custom, 3D-printed torpedo at a target at a distance of up to 5 meters.  It is printed in a FormLabs Form 1 3D printer and coated with a protective sealant.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{media/THRUSTER-RENDER-2-ALPHA.png}
\caption{CAD model of the Seabotix BTD150 thruster}
\label{thruster}
\end{figure}

Six Seabotix BTD150 thrusters drive the vehicle and are arranged for five degrees of freedom - active surge, sway, heave, yaw, and pitch.
